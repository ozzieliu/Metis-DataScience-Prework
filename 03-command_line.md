# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > 1. grep - grep lets you search for text within a file. This is useful to quickly find strings that you want to view or edit.
> > 2. man - displays the help information for the command. Especially helpful when looking up parameters.
> > 3. touch - touch creates a new empty file very quickly. This can be used to create files in preparation to storing data
> > 4. less - prints out the file text but in a interactive way instead of dumping everything with cat
> > 5. rm - removes files or directories
> > 6. pushd and popd - this is new to me. This lets you jump between directories very quickly.
> > 7. env - prints out environment settings. Useful for viewing environment settings to check or to update
> > 8. ls - lists the file contents in the directory
> > 9. chmod - change permission on files. This is used very often to set permissions.
> > 10. sudo - allow super user operation in certain tasks that may be locked to normal user level.
